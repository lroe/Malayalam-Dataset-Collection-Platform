# Malayalam-Dataset-Collection-Platform [Work IN Progress]

This platform enables users to translate English text into Monglish, contributing to the collection of high-quality Malayalam datasets so as to train better language models in malayalam language.

The data collected would be shared publicly.

Key features:

A MySQL database is used to store user information, including username, password, and the number of texts translated.
Users can translate English text and track their progress through their scores.

English texts are uploaded to a central database and displayed randomly for translation.
The translated content will be stored in a seperate table.

Users can review the translated content by upvoting/downvoting to make sure the content is accurate.

This platform aims to enhance the quality and availability of Malayalam datasets by encouraging user participation in translation tasks.
